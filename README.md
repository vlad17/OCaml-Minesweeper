# OCaml-Minesweeper
Brushing up on my OCaml

### TODO

1. Fix bug where you can flag seen squares.
2. On reset, keep the same window (don't just close and re-open)
3. Clear up other todos
4. Change building scheme (what does Jane Street use?)
5. Add unit tests, just to show off
6. Have a machine play (and show the moves as it guesses)

### Development Guide

The game is based on the tutorial from [INRIA](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/oreilly-book/html/book-ora059.html).

I've made some significant changes to the code, though the original model-view-controller outline is more or less the same.
